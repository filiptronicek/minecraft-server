## Usage of these scripts

### `update_paper.py`

This script does one thing and one thing only: it replaces your `paper.jar` (if one exists) with a newly updated build of Paper. Note that this is the latest stable release. 

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed (Python 2 will most likely not work)
2. Run the script with `python3 update_paper.py`
